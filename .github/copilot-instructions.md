This repository is for a Minecraft Education Version Add-On intended to be published for free. 

We use a software called regolith from Bedrock-Oss as a compiler for our files. We use the system_template filter by Nusiq to write modular code. 

We use Node to manage our Typescript modules. The package_lock.json file can be found in `.\regolith\filters_data\`

The inbuild Minecraft modules can be found in the dependencies section of this file `.\regolith\filters_data\system_template\scripting_setup\manifest.json`
